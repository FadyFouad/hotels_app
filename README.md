>A Booking System for a Hotel that has several branches.


## Assignment Brief

It is required to make a Booking System for **a Hotel that has several branches**.  
The  application should be composed of the following components.
1. Booking Database (SQL Lite).
2. An ERD for SQL Lite Database. (pdf or png).
3. Application interface with Flutter, It’s better to use software architecture ex: MVVM,    
   MVP, MVC, etc …
4. A report-like page to display all the rooms in the hotel and their status, e.g., booked,    
   available. This page should authenticate the user before displaying the report.

## Required Considerations

- The system should deal with the hotel branches / locations. The booking needs to be    
  in a specific branch / location of the hotel.
- The system should allow booking several rooms under one booking name.
- The system should give facility to booking rooms of different types, e.g., single,    
  double, suite, and should allow booking multiple persons in a double room or a suite.
- The system should give a discounted price (95%) if the **customer has booked previously** in the hotel.
